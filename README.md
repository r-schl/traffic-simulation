# Traffic Simulation
## Final task 2 of the programming module at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

This is a program that can read from files a network consisting of streets, intersections and cars and simulate a series of ticks on them. It is controlled by user input on the command line. 

- `load <path to configuration files>` reads network configuration from "streets.sim", "cars.sim" and "crossings.sim". 
- `simulate <number of ticks>`  simulates a number of ticks on the network that is currently loaded. 
- `position <ID of a car>` prints information about a specified car.
